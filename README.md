## Introduction

Rule-based chatbots rely on a set of predefined rules and patterns to generate responses. This project showcases a basic implementation of a rule-based chatbot, which can be easily extended to handle more complex interactions. The chatbot uses simple pattern matching techniques to identify user intents and provide appropriate responses.

## Features

- **Pattern Matching**: Uses predefined rules to respond to user input.
- **Customization**: Easily extendable with new patterns and responses.
- **Simple Implementation**: Uses basic Python libraries for quick setup and deployment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab account

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rule-based-chat-bot.git
   cd rule-based-chat-bot
   ```

2. Open the project in Google Colab:

   - Upload the `rule_based_chat_bot.ipynb` notebook to your Google Drive.
   - Open the notebook in Google Colab.

## Usage

1. **Run the Chatbot**:

   Open the `rule_based_chat_bot.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab and run the cells to start the chatbot.

2. **Interact with the Chatbot**:

   Type your messages in the input cell, and the chatbot will respond based on the predefined rules.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot by modifying the rules and responses in the `rule_based_chat_bot.ipynb` notebook. Here's an example of how to add new patterns and responses:

```python
rules = {
    "hi|hello|hey": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Hey!"],
    "how are you": ["I'm good, thank you! How about you?"],
    "what is your name": ["I'm a rule-based chatbot created using Python."],
    "bye|goodbye": ["Goodbye!", "See you later!", "Bye! Take care!"],
}

def respond(user_input):
    for pattern, responses in rules.items():
        if re.search(pattern, user_input, re.IGNORECASE):
            return random.choice(responses)
    return "I'm not sure how to respond to that."

# Example interaction
user_input = "hi"
print(respond(user_input))
```

You can add more patterns and responses to make the chatbot more interactive and engaging.
